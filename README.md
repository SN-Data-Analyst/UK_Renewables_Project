# UK Renewables Project

## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to answer the question: **"Can UK renewables meet energy demands, and what would it cost to go 100% renewable?"**

## Motivation and Importance

The transition to renewable energy is a critical step in addressing the global climate crisis. As the world faces increasing challenges from climate change, such as rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and environmental degradation, the need for sustainable energy solutions has never been more urgent. This project aims to contribute to the understanding of how the UK can reduce its reliance on fossil fuels and move towards a cleaner, greener energy future. By analyzing the feasibility and cost of a 100% renewable energy system, this project seeks to provide actionable insights that can inform policy decisions and promote sustainable development.

## Overview
This project leverages the UK DUKES (Digest of UK Energy Statistics) data to analyze the contribution of renewable energy sources to the overall energy generation in the UK. It examines trends over time and evaluates the feasibility and cost implications of transitioning to a fully renewable energy system.

## Research Questions
This project seeks to address the following key research questions:

1. **Current Renewable Energy Generation**  
    - How much renewable energy does the UK currently generate?  
    - Is that enough to meet the countryâ€™s total energy demand?  

2. **Energy Demand and Shortfall**  
    - How big is the shortfall between renewable generation and demand?  
    - How much would it cost to close that gap with renewables?  

3. **Sector-Specific Energy Usage**  
    - What types of energy are used by each sector (e.g., transport, domestic, industrial)?  
    - How has this changed over time (e.g., 2000 to 2023)?  

## Data Source
The analysis is based on data from the UK DUKES, which provides comprehensive statistics on energy production, consumption, and trends in the UK.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy
- **Data Visualization**: Charts and graphs to illustrate trends and findings
- **Data Source**: UK DUKES dataset

## Deliverables
- A detailed analysis report on the contribution of renewables to the UK's energy generation.
- Visualizations showing trends in renewable energy over time.
- Insights into the feasibility and cost of transitioning to 100% renewable energy.

## Future Work
- Explore the impact of energy storage solutions on renewable energy adoption.
- Analyze the role of government policies and incentives in accelerating the transition to renewables.
- Investigate the environmental and economic benefits of a fully renewable energy system.

## Conclusion
This project aims to provide valuable insights into the UK's renewable energy landscape and contribute to discussions on sustainable energy solutions.
